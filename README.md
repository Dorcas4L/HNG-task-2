# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),making it easy to kickstart your React application development.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you have access to the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Run this script to launch your application in development mode\.Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to see your app in action.
As you make changes to your code, the page will automatically reload\. 
If any lint errors occur, you can check them in the console.


### `npm test`
Use this script to start the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For detailed information on running tests, refer to the section dedicated to tests. [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)


### `npm run build`
Running this script will build your application for production, generating optimized assets in the  `build` folder.\
React will be bundled in production mode for maximum performance. The generated files will be minified, and their filenames will include unique hashes. 
Your application is now ready for deployment!

For further deployment details, please consult the deployment section.[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)


### `npm run eject`

**Note: Ejecting is a one-way operation. Once you've ejected [`eject`], there's no turning back!**

If you find yourself dissatisfied with the build tool and its configurations, you have the option to `eject` at any time. 
Ejecting will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. This grants you full control over these configurations. All other commands except 'eject' will continue to work, but they will now refer to the copied scripts, giving you the flexibility to customize them as needed. From this point forward, you're in complete control of your project.

Remember, ejecting is entirely optional. The predefined feature set is well-suited for small to medium deployments, and there's no obligation to use this feature. However, we recognize that the ability to customize becomes crucial as your project evolves, and this tool provides that flexibility when you're ready for it.
